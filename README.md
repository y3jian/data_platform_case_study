# Data Platform Case Study ðŸ“Š

This code is a case study to convert a stringified table into a clean data frame ready for safe ETL pipelines or data analysis. 

The table displays data of Airline Codes, Delay Times, Flight Codes, and to-from destinations using regex-based standardization, case normalization, and column splitting. 

This project mimicks many of the problems faced in ETL pipelines. Data cleaning is a crucial step to show data consitencies and standardization.
